      Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure)
      of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. 
      
      Think of it like
      this: You order food at a restaurant. The waiter gives you a receipt (the
      Promise). You don't have the food yet, but you know you'll get it
      eventually (or maybe not, if something goes wrong). The receipt lets you
      track the progress of your order and do something once it's ready (or if
      it fails). 
      
      Key Points: States: A Promise can be in one of three states:
      Pending: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. Fulfilled: The
      operation completed successfully. Rejected: The operation failed. Methods:
      .then(): Attaches a callback function to be executed when the Promise is
      fulfilled. .catch(): Attaches a callback function to be executed when the
      Promise is rejected. .finally(): Attaches a callback function to be
      executed regardless of the outcome (fulfilled or rejected).

      Improved Asynchronous Code:
     Promises help avoid the "callback hell" that can occur with nested callbacks.
